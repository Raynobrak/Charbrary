# Charbrary
Charbrary is a C++ library providing utility classes and functions for vector math and collision detection in 2 dimensions.

I *don't* recommend that you use the Charbrary. There are plenty of other Vector Math libraries out there that do much more than the Charbrary ever will.
I've created the Charbrary mainly for myself but thought it would be interesting to make it a public repository if people are curious.
